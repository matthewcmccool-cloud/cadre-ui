## The Insight

Job postings are the most forward-looking public signal of a company's strategic direction. A company posting 15 engineering roles is building. A company posting 10 sales roles is scaling. A company that stops posting is stalling — or about to announce layoffs.

This signal exists in public — scattered across thousands of careers pages and ATS platforms. But nobody has structured it, organized it by investor backing, or made it queryable at portfolio scale.

Cadre does.

---

## What Cadre Is

Cadre is the hiring activity intelligence layer for the venture ecosystem.

We built a knowledge graph connecting **jobs → companies → investors → industries** across 1,300+ VC-backed companies and 7,800+ open roles. Automated pipelines sync daily with ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby — expanding to 6+), detect fundraise events from public sources, and classify every role by function and industry.

This single data asset powers three products at three price points for three markets.

---

## The Category We're Creating

**Hiring Activity Intelligence** — real-time, structured data on who's hiring, how fast, in what functions, and why.

This sits at an unexploited intersection of three mature markets:

**Workforce analytics** (Revelio, Lightcast) sells headcount data to hedge funds at $25-100K+/year. Market-wide, not portfolio-specific. No one serves VCs.

**VC portfolio monitoring** (Visible, Juniper Square, Chronograph) tracks financial KPIs for LP reporting. When headcount appears, it's a single self-reported number. No hiring activity data.

**VC talent platforms** (Getro/Findem, SignalFire Beacon) help VCs distribute portfolio jobs to candidates. Getro was acquired by Findem in December 2025 and is shifting toward AI-powered recruiting intelligence — validating that the market sees value in intelligence on top of job data. But they remain siloed per firm. No cross-portfolio aggregation, no intelligence layer.

Nobody has connected these three domains. Independent research confirms: "No single tool covers portfolio monitoring + talent/hiring + LP reporting" and "most tools track financial performance well but are weak on operational metrics like hiring velocity." The company that names and owns this category has no competition. That's Cadre.

## Three Products, One Data Asset

### Product 1: Cadre Pro (Consumer) — $99/month
Job discovery and hiring intelligence for individual professionals. Browse free forever. Follow companies for alerts and intelligence. Paid features: daily/real-time alerts, knowledge graph context, cross-company comparison, CSV export, surge/stall signals.

$99/month or $79/month annual ($948/year). 14-day opt-out free trial. Single tier. PLG — no sales calls.

**Who pays:** Recruiters, sales/BD teams, and other professionals who need hiring intelligence as a competitive edge. $99/month is a rounding error against a $15K placement fee — and it's still half the price of Getro ($210+/mo) and LinkedIn Recruiter Lite ($170/mo). Priced as professional tooling, not a consumer app.

**Who uses for free:** Job seekers. They're the audience that makes the platform valuable, not the primary revenue source. Free browse + weekly digest keeps them engaged and drives traffic.

### Product 2: Cadre for Funds — $500/month at launch
Hiring activity intelligence dashboard for VC portfolio monitoring. Fund ops selects their portfolio, immediately sees hiring velocity, function mix, surges/stalls, quarter-over-quarter trends. Exportable for LP reports. Zero data collection burden on portfolio companies — a structural advantage over every monitoring tool that requires founder adoption.

**Launch tier:** $500/month for up to 30 portfolio companies. No pricing page — quote in founder-led conversations. This sits below Visible ($449+/mo) as a complementary data layer, not a replacement.

**Expansion tiers (add when demand dictates):**
- Growth: up to 100 companies → $1,500/mo
- Scale: up to 200 companies → $3,000/mo

Don't build these tiers until a customer says "we have 80 portfolio companies, does that work?" Let demand create the pricing, not speculation.

**Who pays:** Fund operations teams, talent partners, GPs.

### Product 3: Cadre API — Consumption-based (future)
The knowledge graph as infrastructure. AI recruiting agents, HR tech platforms, VC tools, and hedge funds consume hiring activity data via API. Build this at $10-15K MRR from Products 1+2, not before.

**Comp:** Crustdata (YC F24) grew from $770K to $4M+ revenue in 7 months selling real-time signals to AI agents.

---

## The Moat

The knowledge graph connecting investor → company → job is something no other platform has. This enables questions nobody else can answer:

- "What is Sequoia's portfolio hiring for this week?"
- "Which Series B AI companies are ramping engineering fastest?"
- "Which of my portfolio companies have stalled hiring for 60+ days?"
- "How does my portfolio's hiring velocity compare to my co-investor's?"

Cross-portfolio aggregation is the unique capability. Getro (now owned by Findem) still siloes each VC's job board. LinkedIn doesn't organize by backing. Wellfound doesn't have the investor layer. SignalFire's Beacon tracks 650M individuals and 500B+ data points but is proprietary and internal-only — not available for purchase.

The data asset compounds daily. Historical hiring data becomes more valuable over time — trend analysis requires longitudinal data that can only be built by starting now.

---

## What We Have vs. What We Don't

**What we have and can credibly sell:** New roles posted, roles removed/closed, posting velocity over time, function mix of open roles, time-roles-stay-open, hiring surges and stalls, fundraise events, cross-portfolio aggregation.

**What we do NOT have and should never claim:** Actual employee headcount, attrition data, employee tenure, compensation data, candidate pipeline volume, LinkedIn-scraped workforce data.

**The honest framing:** We track the *intent to hire*, not the *census of employees*. Hiring activity is a leading indicator. Headcount is a lagging one. We're complementary to workforce analytics platforms like Revelio, not competitive with them.

This distinction matters. Getting it wrong destroys credibility with the exact buyers we need.

---

## Market Validation (February 2026 Research)

Independent research into the VC operations tool landscape confirms several thesis assumptions and sharpens others:

**The gap is real.** No single tool covers portfolio monitoring + talent/hiring + LP reporting. Funds assemble 5-10 tools and manually bridge data. Most portfolio monitoring tools (Visible, Carta, Chronograph) track financial KPIs well but are weak on operational metrics — hiring velocity is explicitly called out as a gap.

**Talent tracking is primitive.** Most VC talent partners track portfolio hiring via spreadsheets, Google Alerts, and ad-hoc introductions. Large funds (a16z) maintain 30-person recruiting teams; smaller funds have 1 person or none. There is no dedicated product for "follow companies → get hiring intelligence with investor context."

**The market is consolidating toward intelligence.** Findem's acquisition of Getro (Dec 2025) signals that raw job aggregation isn't enough — the market wants AI-powered intelligence on top of hiring data. Findem is launching "Intelligent Job Posts" in Q1 2026. S&P Global acquired With Intelligence for $1.8B (Nov 2025). JPMorgan acquired Aumni for $232M. Capital is flowing into private markets data infrastructure.

**Pricing context validates our positioning.** The market supports premium pricing for portfolio tooling:

| Tool | Price | What it does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Rundit | $299/month | Budget portfolio monitoring |
| Zapflow | $199/month | LP portal + deal flow |
| Getro (pre-Findem) | ~$200/month for 30 companies | Single-VC job board |
| Visible.vc | $79-399/month (founder side) | Portfolio updates + LP reporting |
| Carta Fund Admin | $1,500 setup + custom ongoing | Cap table + fund admin |
| Juniper Square | Avg $700K+/year (enterprise) | Investor portals + fund accounting |
| Chronograph | Six figures/year | Portfolio analytics (PE-heavy) |
| Revelio Labs | $25-100K+/year | Workforce analytics (hedge fund buyers) |

Cadre for Funds at $500/month (launch tier, expanding to $1,500-3,000 as demand dictates) sits in the gap between budget tools ($200-300/mo) and institutional platforms ($18K+/year). We're priced as professional tooling for the 1,500-2,500 VC firms with platform teams who can't justify Chronograph but have outgrown spreadsheets.

**Founder reporting friction is our advantage.** VCs burn 500+ hours/year chasing portfolio data. Getting 50+ founders to adopt a new reporting platform is a major adoption barrier for every existing tool. Cadre sidesteps this entirely — we pull from public job postings. Zero burden on portfolio companies. This is a structural advantage no competitor can replicate without rebuilding their data model.

---

## The Conversion Engine

The PLG model is built around a single behavioral trigger: the **speed gap**.

A recruiter or BD professional follows companies on the free tier and gets a weekly Saturday digest. On Friday, they see a role in their feed that was posted Tuesday. A competitor already submitted candidates Wednesday. They're 5 days late. That's the upgrade trigger — not a feature, a *feeling*. The conversion is urgency-driven, not price-sensitive. It works the same at $99 as it would at $79.

**The funnel:**

Anonymous browse (no account) → Click "Follow" → Create free account → Onboarding (select companies) → Free dashboard + weekly digest → Speed gap felt → Start 14-day trial (payment info upfront) → Convert to $99/month

Free is genuinely useful — unlimited follows, activity feed, weekly email. But it's *slow* (weekly only) and *shallow* (no graph context, no comparisons, no surge/stall alerts). Pro is *fast* and *deep*. Speed and depth are what professionals pay for — and expense on a work card without blinking.

**The weekly digest email is the product.** It retains, converts, and distributes. If the Saturday email is the best thing in their inbox, everything else works. If it's generic, nothing else matters.

---

## How We Build

Solo founder + AI agent stack. This is the operating model, not a limitation.

**OpenClaw** (AI operations agent, Mac Mini M4) runs 24/7: ATS syncing, company enrichment, fundraise detection, content drafting, anomaly detection, data quality monitoring. Reports via Telegram.

**Claude Code** handles frontend development: PLG rebuild, auth, payments, UI iteration. 16-prompt implementation sequence targeting a complete rebuild during the cabin sprint.

**Claude (Opus)** provides strategic planning, spec writing, and architectural decisions.

One founder shipping at the pace of a 5-person team. Infrastructure cost under $400/month.

---

## The Technical Transition

Migrating from Airtable to Supabase (Postgres) during the cabin sprint. This unlocks:

- No more 5 req/sec API rate limits
- Proper foreign keys and junction tables for the knowledge graph
- Sub-50ms query times (vs. Airtable's 200-500ms)
- Real-time subscriptions for live feed updates
- company_daily_metrics time-series table powering sparklines, trends, surge/stall detection, the content engine, and the future fund dashboard

The Supabase schema is designed for all three products from day one. Core data tables (companies, jobs, investors, fundraises) plus user data tables (follows, alert preferences, feed events, daily metrics) plus computed views for real-time stats.

---

## Go-to-Market Sequence

**Phase 1 — Build (Feb-Mar 2026):** Cabin sprint. OpenClaw enriches database, expands ATS coverage, launches fundraise detection. Claude Code ships the full PLG rebuild. Supabase migration. Site goes "public ready."

**Phase 2 — Audience (Mar-May 2026):** Content engine goes live. LinkedIn posts 3x/week + weekly newsletter. Seed "hiring activity intelligence" as a concept through data-driven insights. Don't name the category yet — demonstrate it. Target: 1,000 newsletter subscribers, 2,000+ weekly site visitors.

**Phase 3 — Validate (May-Jul 2026):** First paying Pro users. Target: 50 subscribers (~$5K MRR). Begin 5-10 conversations with fund ops teams. Show them their own portfolio data. Apply to accelerators with validated traction.

**Phase 4 — Scale (Jul-Dec 2026):** Launch Cadre for Funds at $500/mo starter tier. Target: 10-20 fund customers ($5-10K MRR). Introduce Growth/Scale tiers as larger funds request them. Consumer continues growing ($10-12K MRR). Combined: $15-22K+ MRR by year end. Begin API alpha.

**Phase 5 — Expand (2027):** Growth/Scale fund tiers ($1,500-3,000/mo). API launch. Geographic expansion (London/EU). Target: $100K MRR.

---

## Revenue Path

| Product | Price | Target End of 2026 | MRR |
|---------|-------|--------------------|-----|
| Consumer Pro | $99/month ($79/mo annual) | 125 subscribers | $10-12K |
| Fund Dashboard | $500/month (launch tier) | 10-20 funds | $5-10K |
| Fund Growth/Scale tiers | $1,500-3,000/month | As demand dictates | TBD |
| API | Consumption-based | Design partners only | — |
| **Combined** | | | **$15-22K+** |

Path to $100K MRR within 18-24 months of launch.

---

## Category Creation Through Content

The category doesn't exist until people use the phrase. The content strategy has three phases:

**Phase 1 (Mar-Apr):** Demonstrate the data. Publish insights from the knowledge graph without naming the category. "Sequoia's portfolio posted 89 roles this week. 60% engineering." Let the audience discover the value.

**Phase 2 (May-Jun):** Name it. "We call it Hiring Activity Intelligence — the most forward-looking operational signal in the venture ecosystem." Publish the canonical definition posts.

**Phase 3 (Jul+):** Own it. Monthly hiring activity reports. Quarterly LP-ready summaries. Conference presence. Own the search term. By the time the fund product launches, GPs should already associate Cadre with this data.

---

## Why This Is Venture-Scale

**Data asset compounds.** Every day the pipeline runs, the graph gets richer. Historical data can't be recreated by a competitor who starts later.

**Three monetization surfaces** from one asset: consumer PLG, fund subscriptions, API consumption.

**Network effects.** More companies tracked → more useful for job seekers → more traffic → more valuable to recruiters → more valuable to funds → justifies tracking more companies.

**Category creation.** The founder who names and owns "hiring activity intelligence" has disproportionate upside.

**Why now:** VCs burn 500+ hours/year chasing portfolio data from companies. Hiring/talent sourcing is the #1 support request from portfolio companies (Visible.vc survey). Most talent partners still track portfolio hiring via spreadsheets and Google Alerts. The Getro/Findem acquisition (Dec 2025) signals the market is waking up to intelligence on top of job data, but nobody has built cross-portfolio hiring intelligence. Meanwhile, 2025 was the second-strongest year for US VC ($340B invested), extending holding periods are increasing demand for monitoring tools, and AI recruiting agents are emerging as a new buyer for structured hiring data.

---

## What Not to Build

- Candidate profiles / resume database (LinkedIn owns this)
- ATS / CRM for companies (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby own this)
- Full workforce analytics competing with Revelio (different data, different market)
- White-label job boards competing with Getro/Findem (800+ VC clients, AI recruiting pivot, different game)
- Salary benchmarking (don't have the data)

## What to Protect

- The knowledge graph (investor → company → job) — this is the moat
- Data freshness — stale data = dead product
- The "hiring activity intelligence" category name — own it before anyone else
- Cross-portfolio aggregation — the one thing nobody else can do

---

## The Downside Floor

Even if the fund product and API never materialize, the consumer product alone at $99/month with 125+ subscribers generates $12K+ MRR — a sustainable business that covers costs and provides optionality. The knowledge graph and content engine have standalone value as a hiring intelligence platform.

The fund product and API are the upside. The consumer product is the floor.
