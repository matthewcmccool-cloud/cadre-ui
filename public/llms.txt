## Data Available

- **Companies** (~1,300+): Name, website, funding stage, industry, headquarters,
  investors (VCs), open role count, hiring velocity. Each company page lists
  all current open roles with title, location, function, and posting date.

- **Jobs** (~16,000+): Title, company, location, function (Engineering, Sales,
  Product, etc.), industry, date posted, apply URL, full description. Sourced
  directly from verified company career pages via ATS APIs.

- **Investors** (~200+): Name, website, portfolio companies, aggregate role count
  across portfolio. Each investor page shows all open roles at their portfolio
  companies.

- **Industries**: Sector classifications (AI & Machine Learning, Fintech,
  Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Developer Tools, etc.) linking companies and jobs.

- **Fundraises**: Recent funding rounds with company, amount, stage, lead
  investor, and co-investors.

## Knowledge Graph Structure

The core value is relational queries across entities:

    Investor → funds → Company → has → Jobs
    Company → in → Industry
    Company → at stage → Funding Stage (Seed, Series A, B, C, D+)

This enables questions like:
- "Which Sequoia portfolio companies are hiring engineers?"
- "What Series B AI companies are adding headcount?"
- "Who are the fastest-hiring companies backed by a16z?"
- "What are the top hiring functions at Founders Fund portfolio companies?"
- "Which cybersecurity startups raised recently and are now hiring?"
- "What VC-backed companies are hiring product managers in New York?"
